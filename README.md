# Pandemic Simulation - Research Project at SUNY Korea

This is a personal project that I am doing under supervision of Alex Kuhn and is a part of CSE487 research project.
### [Live demo](https://janarosmonaliev.github.io/research-simulations/)

## Simulation topic and purpose

I decided to stick with a pandemic simulation on a small city, like Songdo. The main purpose of the project is to display how immunization, social distancing, and other measures affect the spread of the pandemic in an interactive way. However, I do not intend to make future predictions, it will be made solely for educational/entertaining purposes.

## Simulation type & Complexity

To make the project more feasible it's important to start with as little variables as possible and incrementally increase complexity on the go.
As a starting point, the population will be homogeneous with only one characteristic: whether one has a mask or not. Simulation type will be based on the SIR model. Here are some great examples I found on the web:

- [Kevin Simpler - Playable Simulations](https://meltingasphalt.com/interactive/outbreak/)
- [Primer - Epidemic Simulations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OLpKqTriio&)

## What I have tried so far:

- [Harp.gl (WebGL, Three.js)](https://janarosmonaliev.github.io/research-simulations/harp.gl-test/) - It transforms maps into 3D objects and has a tilt camera if you move your mouse while pressing right click. Unfortunately, it does not have Songdo's map; it also doesn't accept other map data sources. Framework is relatively new, so there is no way to interact with buildings. However, it has great data visualization capabilities.

- [Tangram.js (WebGL)](https://janarosmonaliev.github.io/research-simulations/tangram.js-test/) - This framework is less fancier and does not have 3D functions. But, I have access to buildings that are displayed on the map. Plus, it has good documentation. However, it's not suitable for simulations because open-sourced maps are not reliable for route finding.

## Starting everything from scratch...

I decided to start everything from scratch using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). I will be implementing a city in a 3D space. So far, I managed to understand how 3D space works in Three.js, along with lighting and shadows. My next goal is to automate city generation with roads. After, I will proceed to simulation process by adding synthetic blobs.

## Generated City

I was inspired by [That French Game Dev](https://thatfrenchgamedev.com/)'s algorithm for three.js city generation he wrote back in 2014. Basically, the city is generated by diving the plane into horizontal and vertical segments with random lengths and filling every other segment with buildings. My next step is to finally start thinking through the pandemic animation and visualization.

## City graph creation and movement algorithm

In order to move the blobs around the city, I needed to create a topological graph for them to traverse through. However, I realized that it would be computationally heavy to run Dijkstra's algorithm on each blob (5x5 district city would have 84 nodes and 98 vector edges!). Plus, the city's structure is simple enough to programmatically calculate the paths. So, I generated vector paths for each blob and on each rendering invocation, the algorithm moves the blob along the vector. Source and destinations for each blob are generated randomly.

## Simulation
Simulation algorithm takes an initial number of infected blobs and spreads it to a specified number of people (physical contact) with a specified probability on each day. Days in this algorithm are defined in terms of back-and-forth travels that blobs make.

Additional controls were added so that users could play with simulations. They can adjust the population size, their speed, initial infected blobs etc. Due to the inherent structure of the algorithm, blob speed may vary across devices, as it depends on the speed of the CPU clock. Also, it is important to press the reload button when changing the population size, as it clears the blob objects from heap to avoid overflowing it. The project is not yet optimized (THREE.js was imported entirely, resulting in 27K line code in build output), and my **620-line index.js** definitely needs some refactoring. Control features are still in development phase, so be ready for potential bugs. Peace!

## Usage

To be able to run Three.js project as a static website (e.g. on Github Pages), I have used [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and configured development and production bundles:

```bash
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "build": "webpack --config=webpack.prod.js",
    "build-dev": "webpack --config=webpack.dev.js",
    "start": "webpack-dev-server --open --config=webpack.dev.js"
  },
```

```cmd
  npm start        # development build (live on localhost)
  npm run build    # static production build
```
